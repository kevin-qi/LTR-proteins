The dataset used in this project is obtained from the following.

Wu, Nicholas C, et al. “Adaptation in Protein Fitness Landscapes Is Facilitated by Indirect Paths.” ELife, vol. 5, 2016, doi:10.7554/elife.16965.

Directed evolution is a powerful technique to design novel proteins. This process uses iterative rounds of experimental measurements and screening to accumulate mutations that promote desired behaviors of a protein. Due to the enormous size of the genotype space (a 4 residue genotype space contains 160,000 variants) and the high cost of experimental measurements, this method is limited to very small regions of the available genotype space. Machine learning has been utilized to augment directed evolution processes to more efficiently explore the genotype-fitness landscape. This project aims to utilize an empirical protein fitness landscape dataset of 4 epistatic residues as a test bed for benchmarking various machine learning models.
